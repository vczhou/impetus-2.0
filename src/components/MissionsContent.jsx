        Unreached of the Day: Fulani, Maasina in Mali
      </p>
      <img src="../assets/unreachedOfTheDay.jpg" width="400px" alt="Unreached of the Day"/>
      <p>
        Population: 1,253,000
      </p>
      <p>        
        Language: Fulfulde, Maasina
      </p>
      <p>
        Religion: Islam
      </p>
      <p>        
        Status: Unreached
      </p>
      <p>
        The Fulani people comprise the largest nomadic society in the world. The Fula Maasina are located predominantly in the Maasina region of Mali. The culture and lifestyle of the Fula Maasina who live there are virtually identical to those of the other Fulani peoples in West Africa. Houses belonging to the settled Fula Maasina are typically round with mud walls and thatched roofs. They are strongly Sunni Muslim.

        Ministry Obstacles
      </p>
      <p>
        The identity of the Fulani tribes has long been tied to Islam. To follow Jesus as a Fulani is to risk cutting oneself off from family and friends--serious losses indeed.

        Outreach Ideas
      </p>
      <p>        
        Sustained and focused prayer is needed for the Fulani tribes, to prepare their hearts. Many Christian workers are needed for these large tribes. Pray for workers, for the harvest is ripening.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pray for the Followers of Christ
      </p>
      <p>
        Pray the few Christian believers among the Maasina Fulani will be sent teachers and materials to help them grow in Christ. They need prayer support. Pray they will clearly understand the Gospel of grace, not mixing it with the religion of good works. Pray they will see the need to be obedient to Christ out of gratitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pray for the Entire People Group
      </p>
      <p>
        Pray the large Fulani tribes of West Africa will be able to care adequately for their families, that they will have sufficient rain for their livestock and crops. Pray they will make schooling a priority for their children. Pray for the widow and orphan, that they be cared for by the community.
